Imagine building a small shop website:

Variables → Store product price

Array → List of products

Object → Product details

Function → Calculate total price

Condition → If total > $100 → give discount

Loop → Show all products

Event → When user clicks “Buy”

DOM → Show “Thank you” message

Everything works together.
